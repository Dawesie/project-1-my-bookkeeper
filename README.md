# My Personal Bookkeeper
My personal bookkeeper website is a landing platform for sole traders and small to medium businesses who are looking for a bookkeeper to assist them with keeping their financial records.

Persons using the website will find information about the credentials of the bookkeeper as well as the bookkeeping services that are available.


## Features 
### Header

- The names used for the navigation bar elements gives a clear indication of what is available on each page.

This section at the footer of each page gives the user the opportunity to glean more information about the company and the ethos of the company.
The follow us links will open in a new tab so that the user can still stay linked to company website.


### User experience
- A first-time user will get value from the site because the landing page gives a clear indication of what the site is for, and the navigation bar by their titles indicates what information is available on the pages of the site.  The follow me, will allow the first-time user to glean additional information about the business and the owner.

- Users returning to the site will also get value from the site because the layout is simple, navigation bar is easy to find, and they will be able to navigate quickly to the information they are searching for.
